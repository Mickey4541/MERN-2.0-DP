- Typescript is not understand by the browser. But is is transpiled by the browser into javascript.

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and type-checking capabilities. This means you can define types (such as string, number, boolean, etc.) for variables, function parameters, and return values, which helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime.
