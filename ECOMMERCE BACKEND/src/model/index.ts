//our medium to connect with the database is sequelize.so, we have to import it. It gives Sequelize class and DataTypes. DataTypes means (hamile hamro db table ko columns ko datatypes k rahhni ho like integer, string vanni chij DataTypes bata aauxa. ) and Sequelize to do instantiation.

import  {Sequelize, DataTypes} from 'sequelize'

//In Sequelize, an instance is an object created from a class (in this case, the Sequelize class). When you write const sequelize = new Sequelize(...), you're creating an instance of the Sequelize class with your database configuration.

    host : dbConfig.host,
    dialect : dbConfig.dialect,

    }

//authenticate is a method of the Sequelize instance (object) that checks if the connection to the database is successful.

// sequelize.authenticate() returns a promise that resolves if the connection is successful and rejects if thereâ€™s an error.

// .then() handles the resolved state of the promise, logging "Connected."

// .catch() handles any rejection (error), logging the error message.

sequelize.authenticate().then(()=>{
    console.log('Connected');
})
.catch((err)=>{
    console.log(err);
    
})
